# PowerBi_project_AdventureWorks
I have crafted this project for AdventureWorks, a fictional company created by Microsoft. 

My project aims at providing business insights that can be utilized in optimizing sales performance and enhancing customer insights for various stakeholders of Adventure Works.

This project offers four comprehensive views: 

Bikes Sales Overview: 
This Bikes Sales Overview Dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of sales performance, costs, and key financial metrics to help stakeholders in strategic decision-making. 

Time-Based Analysis: 
This dashboard helps stakeholders track seasonal sales trends, analyze category-wise contributions, and evaluate net profit and sales over time.

Customer Analysis: 
This dashboard helps stakeholders understand customer behaviours, key segments, and retention trends, enabling data-driven strategies for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

Geographical Analysis: 
This dashboard helps stakeholders analyze geographical sales trends, identify key markets, and optimize logistics strategies for efficient order fulfillment and growth.
